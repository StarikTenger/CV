# Projects
* [Formal Language Converter](https://github.com/StarikTenger/Chipollino) **[C++ | LaTeX]**

    Study project on **Formal Language Theory**. Computes operations over *regular expressions* and *finite automata* an generates a step-by-step description of all transitions in *LaTeX*. My contribution to the project is managing workflow in the team of 9 members, writing an interpreter and implementing testing using *github actions*

* [Regular Language Problem](https://github.com/StarikTenger/RegularLanguageProblem) **[C++]**

    Determining if a *fromal grammar* defines a *regular language* using some approximations. Written under the **Formal Language Theory** contest

* [SpaceSodomy2](https://github.com/StarikTenger/SpaceSodomy2) **[C++ | SFML, Box2d]**
    
    Game developed by the group of BMSTU and MIPT students. It is a 2d multiplayer space-shooter which takes all features of newton mechanics such as linear and angular inertia.
    My own contribution is implementing client-server architecture and containing leadership over the project.
* [MimicGame](https://github.com/bmstu-iu9/ptp2021-6-2d-game) **[Typescript]**

    University project made during summer practice. Consists of two parts: the game itself and a level editor for it. My contribution was setting up project architecture and organising workflow using **trello**.

* [University Programming](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU) **[Scheme, C, C++, go, java, assembly, haskell]**

    Code I wrote in terms of university studying. Some remarkable projects:

    * [Martelli-Montanari term unification algorithm on **haskell**](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU/tree/master/formal-languages/lab1-martelli-montanari)
    * [stack programming language interpretor on **scheme**](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU/blob/master/scheme-labs/LAB_5.scm)
    * [big number computation on **assembly**](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU/tree/master/assembler/labs/lab4%2B)
