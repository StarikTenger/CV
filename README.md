# Projects
* [SpaceSodomy2](https://github.com/StarikTenger/SpaceSodomy2) **[C++ | SFML, Box2d]**
    
    Game developed by the group of BMSTU and MIPT students. It is a 2d multiplayer space-shooter which takes all features of newton mechanics such as linear and angular inertia.
    My own contribution is writting the whole server architecture and containing leadership over the project.
* [Voxel Engine](https://github.com/StarikTenger/VoxelRendering) **[C++, GLSL | OpenGL]**

    Voxel graphics visualizer, working over OpenGL and GLSL-shaders. Main features are octree-optimized raymarching and parsing voxel models.
* [RayMarching](https://github.com/StarikTenger/RayMarching) **[C++, GLSL | SFML]**

    Raymarching on shaders, but rays follow parabolas instead of streight lines.

* [MimicGame](https://github.com/StarikTenger/MimicGame) **[Typescript]**

    University project made during summer practice. Consists of two parts: the game itself and a level editor for it. My contribution was setting up project architecture and organising workflow using **trello**.

* [University Programming](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU) **[Scheme, C, C++, go, java, assembly]**

    Code I wrote in terms of university studying. Some remarkable projects:

    * [stack programming language interpretor on scheme](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU/blob/master/scheme-labs/LAB_5.scm)
    * [big number computation on assembly](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU/tree/master/assembler/labs/lab4%2B)
