# Projects
* [Formal Language Converter](https://github.com/StarikTenger/Chipollino) **[C++ | LaTeX]**

    Study project on **Formal Language Theory**. Computes operations over *regular expressions* and *finite automata* an generates a step-by-step description of all transitions in *LaTeX*. The purpose of the project is to provide peolple with an oportunity to learn formal languages in an interactive way. 
    
    My contribution to the project is managing workflow in the team of 9 members, writing an interpreter and implementing testing using *github actions*

* [PathTracing](https://github.com/StarikTenger/PathTracing) **[C++, GLSL | OpenGL]**

    Implementation of path tracing algorithm. My coursework on the topic of **Computer Graphics**

* [SpaceSodomy2](https://github.com/StarikTenger/SpaceSodomy2) **[C++ | SFML, Box2d]**
    
    Game developed by the group of BMSTU and MIPT students. It is a 2d multiplayer space-shooter which takes all features of newton mechanics such as linear and angular inertia.
    
    My own contribution is implementing client-server architecture and containing leadership over the project.
    
* [MimicGame](https://github.com/bmstu-iu9/ptp2021-6-2d-game) **[Typescript]**

    University project made during summer practice. Consists of two parts: the game itself and a level editor for it. My contribution was setting up project architecture and organising workflow using **trello**.

* [University Programming](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU) **[Scheme, C, C++, go, java, assembly, haskell]**

    Code I wrote in terms of university studying. Some remarkable projects:

    * [Martelli-Montanari term unification algorithm](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU/tree/master/formal-languages/lab1-martelli-montanari)  on **haskell**
    * [stack programming language interpreter](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU/blob/master/scheme-labs/LAB_5.scm) on **scheme**
    * [big number computation](https://github.com/StarikTenger/BMSTU/tree/master/assembler/labs/lab4%2B) on **assembly**
